We'd like to follow this python style guide: [pythonstyle]

> Please be consistent.
> If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
> determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators,
> you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them,
> make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.
