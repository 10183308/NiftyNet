NiftyNet
========

NiftyNet is an open-source convolutional neural networks (CNN) platform for
research in medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention.
**NiftyNet is not intended for clinical use**.

Features
========

* Easy-to-customise interfaces of network components
* Designed for sharing networks and pretrained models
* Designed to support 2-D, 2.5-D, 3-D, 4-D inputs (2.5-D: volumetric images processed as a stack of 2D slices; 4-D: co-registered multi-modal 3D volumes)
* Efficient discriminative training with multiple-GPU support
* Implemented recent networks (HighRes3DNet, 3D U-net, V-net, DeepMedic)
* Comprehensive evaluation metrics for medical image segmentation
